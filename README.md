## Small script collection for android package managment

As there is virtually no free Android Mobile Managment Devices tools for small non profits organisation at the moment, I decided to sharpen my own tools for backups, restore, listing and others operations on android packages. Theses batch/adb scripts are draft material for more advanced operation, but they are already operationnal for android application deployment on rooted devices with Neo-backup and AppManager backup files.
